# Traffic Simulation Project

## Overview
This project is a traffic simulation program developed using C++ and the SFML library. It aims to simulate realistic vehicle movement through an intersection by applying principles from various traffic theories. The simulation provides insights into traffic flow dynamics and can be used as a tool for understanding and analyzing traffic behavior under different conditions.

## Traffic Theory Application
The simulation integrates several key concepts from traffic flow theory to model realistic vehicle behaviors and interactions. These include:

- **Right-Hand Traffic Rule**: Adhering to the common practice in many countries, vehicles in the simulation drive on the right-hand side of the road.

- **Green-Shields Model**: This fundamental traffic flow model is used to describe the relationship between speed, density, and flow of traffic, helping to simulate realistic vehicle speeds and spacing.

- **Queueing Theory**: At intersections, queueing theory principles are applied to manage vehicle queues and simulate waiting times, reflecting real-world traffic light and stop sign behaviors.

- **Gap Acceptance Theory**: This theory is used to model how drivers decide to make turns or cross intersections based on the gaps in traffic flow, adding to the realism of the simulation.

- **Kinematic Wave Theory of Traffic Flow**: This theory helps in simulating the propagation of traffic waves and congestion patterns that emerge in traffic streams.

By incorporating these theories, the simulation aims to provide a realistic representation of traffic flow, offering valuable insights into traffic dynamics and potential improvements in traffic management and control strategies.

## Requirements
- C++ Compiler (C++17 standard)
- SFML Library (version 2.6.1 or higher)

## Installation and Running
1. **Clone the Repository:**
2. **Build the Project:**
3. **Run the Simulation:**

## Usage
After running the simulation, a window will display the traffic simulation. Vehicles will appear from different directions and move through the intersection.
