# Traffic Simulation Project

## Overview
This project is a traffic simulation program built using C++ and the SFML library. It simulates vehicles moving through an intersection, following basic traffic rules.
This project will be expanded to use different pathing algorithms for the vehicles, once the driving logic is finishes.

## Features
- Simulated traffic flow through an intersection.
- Vehicles follow basic traffic rules and drive on the right side of the road.
- Vehicles are spawned at regular intervals from different directions.

## Requirements
- C++ Compiler (C++17 standard)
- SFML Library (version 2.6.1 or higher)

## Installation and Running
1. **Clone the Repository:**
2. **Build the Project:**
3. **Run the Simulation:**

## Usage
After running the simulation, a window will display the traffic simulation. Vehicles will appear from different directions and move through the intersection.
